    <h1>Cheeseburgers</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      My favorite food growing up. This is a very simple recipe that is good for beginners.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Olive Oil</li>
      <li>Burger Patty</li>
      <li>Burger Bun</li>
      <li>Cheese of your choice</li>
      <li>Romaine Lettuce</li>
      <li>Tomato (Optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Place a pan on a stovetop. Lubricate the pan with olive oil, and set the stovehead underneath this pan to medium heat. </li>
      <li>Once the pan reaches an appropriate temperature, place the burger patty on the pan. Flip the patty every one to two minutes.</li>
      <li>(Optional) In the meantime, toast your burger buns to your liking.</li>
      <li>Use an instant-read thermometer to periodically measure the burger's temperature. It will be safe to consume after it has reached 145&deg; F, but you can continue cooking it to your liking after this stage.</li>
      <li>Before you decide to take the patty off, add the cheese so it meltsnicely once you're done cooking the patty.</li>
      <li>When the patty is done cooking, place it on top of your bun. Place tyour toppings on top of your bun.</li>
