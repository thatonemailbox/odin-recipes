    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>5 pounds potatoes</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons garlic salt</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons paprika</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons black pepper</li>
      <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
      <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> teaspoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>Vegetable oil of choice for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Scrub the potatoes under water until totally clean.</li>
      <li>Use a mandolin or a Japanese slicer to slice the potatoes as thinly as possible. As you slice them, submerge them in cold water and set aside. Lay the potatoes on a baking sheet lined with paper towels, and blot them with more paper towels to dry completely.</li>
      <li>Mix together the garlic salt, paprika, black pepper, and salt in a small bowl and set aside.</li>
      <li>In 2 heavy Dutch ovens, heat some vegetable oil to 375&deg; F, while using a thermometer to check its temperature regularly.</li>
      <li>When the oil is ready, lower batches of the potatoes into the oil using a spatula. They will fry in about 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> minutes. Remove the batch with a spatula when they're nice and golden and crisp. Immediately afterwards, sprinkle on the spice mix. Repeat with the rest of the potatoes.</li>
    </ol>
