    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Fresh Ginger</li>
      <li>Limes</li>
      <li>White or Brown Sugar</li>
      <li>Drinking Water</li>
      <li>Carbonated Water</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Remove skin from ginger by sliding across it with a spoon (alternative: use a carrot peeler). Then dice the ginger.</li>
      <li>Add the diced ginger into a saucepan. For every cup of ginger, we will add two cups of water. For a decent amount of ginger ale to consume for the week, use two cups of ginger.</li>
      <li>Grate some of the lime so that the shavings fall into the saucepan.</li>
      <li>Heat the mixture to boil. Once it is boiling, turn the heat down and place a cover over the pan. Wait 15 minutes.</li>
      <li>Run the mixture through a strainer, and collect the juices that fall from the strainer. Push down on the solid matter in the strainer with a spoon or a bowl to get as much juice out as possible.</li>
      <li>Add the juice back into the pan. For each cup of ginger, add a cup of sugar.</li>
      <li>Heat the liquid back to a simmer. Let it cool for 15 minutes, stirring regularly.</li>
      <li>Afterwards, place the liquid in a bowl, and let it cool for an hour.</li>
      <li>If storing, place the syrup in an airtight container. It should last like this for about 2 weeks before going bad.</li>
      <li>If serving, mix the syrup with carbonated water. Optinally, you can add lime juice to change the flavor a bit.</li>
    </ol>
